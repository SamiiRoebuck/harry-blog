metaDescription: Illustrations of Marvel Characters from A to Z.

As a massive nerd and comic book lover, picking some of my favourite characters is really difficult, but here's an A-Z collection of some of my favourite Marvel Characters as well as some relatively unheard ones, as well as the occasional ridiculous character.



### A: Aaron Davis

Aaron Davis, a.k.a The Prowler, stylised like 'Into the Spiderverse'



### B: Black Panther

### C: Captain Midlands

As a fellow Midlander I felt compelled to take this chance to illustrate Captain Midlands. As far as I know he's the only regional hero figurehead rather than national ones like Captain America, Captain Britain, and Black Panther. Visually his outfit is similar to Captain America's in The First Avenger when busting the 107th out of a Hydra facility. Captain Midlands even carries a circular shield much like Cap, with a coating of Nanominium, which is extremely durable and resistant to magical attacks, but features a lion rampant on the front.

If Marvel ever wants anyone to play Captain Midlands I'd be happy to oblige.
