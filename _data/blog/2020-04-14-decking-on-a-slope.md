metaDescription: A blog post about building decking.
---
This project post is less of an exact tutorial, mainly because of the nature of the slope in our garden, and is in fact more of a ‘how we did it’ rather than the wholly correct way of building decking in any garden.

## **Tools used**

* Cordless Circular Saw
* Hand saw
* Cordless Combi Drill
* Mallet
* Spirit Level
* Square

## Materials used

* 45 x 95mm profile Treated timber in multiple lengths (2 x 3.6m, 3 x 3m, 1 x 2.4m)
* 45 x 170mm profile sleeper, 3m length
* 16 lengths of 25 x 120mm profile decking board, 1.8m length
* 200 6 x 80mm woodscrews

## Limitations of the project

We, like many others rent our house, which is a big problem for most people trying to make the most from their space but for a limited time. The other main issue in place with our property is that we live on hill, which isn’t the steepest gradient but is still significant enough to mean we can’t just put a shed on the floor of the garden meaning we needed a way to have a level floor to our garden, for which we considered several different way of levelling the floor.

We thought about removing enough ground in the corner of the garden to meet the lowest portion of the garden. This would have meant permanently altering the garden for which we don’t have approval from out Landlord for, but also shifting away a lot of debris. My next though was to build a mould around the area we wanted levelling and pouring concrete in to create a raised platform. The problem with this is that we would be permanently be changing the garden, and creating a great big concrete platform which would be an eyesore.

The third option was by far the best one, which you can already see from the image at the top of the page was to create a freestanding decking that is strong enough to withstand the weight of a shed, and can be easily removed when we move out of this house in a few years form now.

## Planning

Above, is the sketch that I planned for lengths of timber to buy for the frame and supports.

Here is a quick mock up of what the decking frame will look like above the sloped garden floor, one in CAD on Fusion 360 and one Sketched in Procreate.

The back corner is resting directly on the concrete floor, and all other corners are propped up by the base which can be seen in the sketch below, shaded in red, and the orange box is where I’m hoping to place the shed in future.



## Cutting List

* From both 3.6m lengths; 2m + 2 x 607cm
* From two 3m lengths; 1.61m + 2 x 607cm
* From one 3m length; 1.61m + 607cm
* From the 1.24m length; 1.61m
* From the 3m length sleeper; 1.7m
